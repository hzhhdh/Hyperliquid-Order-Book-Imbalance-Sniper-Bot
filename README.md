## How It Works
The bot operates by:
1. Subscribing to order book updates via Hyperliquidâ€™s WebSocket API for the specified trading pairs.
2. Calculating the total buy and sell volumes within the defined price range (e.g., Â±1% from the current price).
3. Checking for imbalances:
- If buy volume exceeds sell volume by the specified ratio (e.g., 2:1), it places a buy order.
- If sell volume exceeds buy volume, it places a sell order.
4. Executing trades using the configured order type (market or limit) and trade size.
