  - Monitors exposure and automatically rebalances the portfolio according to predefined risk tolerance levels.

- **⚡ Strategy Engine**: Dynamic stop-loss, portfolio exposure limits, and asset correlation tracking.
  - Houses a library of deterministic, rule‑based trading strategies.
  - Includes strategies for trend following, mean reversion, arbitrage, and hedging.
  - Allows users to “atomize” complex strategies into independent modules (entry, exit, sizing, hedging) that can be mixed and matched.

- **🔀 Backtesting and Optimization Engine**:
  - Provides a local simulation environment where strategies can be tested against historical market data.
  - Allows parameter tuning (e.g., adjusting moving average periods, volatility thresholds) without machine learning—using grid searches or heuristic optimizations.
  - Outputs performance metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio, drawdown, win percentage) to help refine strategies.

- **⚡ Execution and Order Management**:
  - Automates order placement with predefined rules and dynamic order types (limit, market, TWAP).
  - Monitors order status and adapts order placement based on real‑time liquidity and price fluctuations.

- **🤖 Dashboard and Control Interface**: Front-run liquidation bots and dark pools.
  - Offers a user‑friendly local GUI for monitoring trades, performance, and market conditions.
  - Provides manual override capabilities and logging for transparency.
  - Displays alerts and risk signals, ensuring you are informed at all times.

- **🐆 Instant Trading**: Unlike manual trading through Trust Wallet or MetaMask, where transaction confirmations can take 20 to 60 seconds, our bot ensures instant trades by sending them directly to the validator network.
