# EigenLayer DeFi Arbitrage Bot
<p align="center"><img width="800" height="500" src="defiarbitrage/1.png" alt="Bot interface" /></p>

This bot runs seamlessly across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and other EVM chains, automating delta‑neutral stETH/ETH arbitrage via Curve and Lido V3 Vaults, with real‑time mempool monitoring, Flashbots MEV protection, and dynamic EigenLayer restaking for maximum yield optimization. 🚀 Connect multiple wallets through the intuitive GUI, customize slippage, leverage, and APR triggers per account, and let our high‑performance Rust + Python engine handle order execution, risk controls, and reporting—so you can focus on scaling your DeFi profits. 📈

> In brief, this application combines a lightweight Rust/Tauri GUI with a Rust‑based event‑driven engine (Botvana/Barter‑rs) and an async Python Web3 module (web3.py v7) to automate delta‑neutral arbitrage, Curve pool trades, and dynamic restaking on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and beyond. It leverages Flashbots MEV protection, Lido V3 Vaults, EigenLayer restaking, and multi‑wallet profiles, delivering sub‑second execution, robust risk controls, and enterprise‑grade signing via Nethereum. 🚀

Our cross‑platform desktop bot runs on macOS, Windows, and any EVM‑compatible chain—Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism—thanks to full EVM equivalence and seamless Solidity support. It manages multiple wallets through an intuitive GUI, each with bespoke triggers, thresholds, and API endpoints.

- High‑Performance Engine
Rust + Botvana/Barter‑rs for ultra‑low‑latency signal processing, Python + web3.py v7.0 for mempool monitoring, and Flashbots support for front‑running defense. 🏎️💨

- Strategies Included
    - Delta‑Neutral (stETH → Aave → borrow ETH → short ETH, automatic rebalance) 🔄
    - Peg‑Arbitrage (Curve stETH/ETH deviation triggers) 📈
    - Auto‑Restaking (EigenLayer & Lido V3 triggers based on APR & capacity) 🔒

- Risk Controls
Slippage caps, max gas price, global stop‑loss/take‑profit, validator health checks—keep your DeFi portfolio safe! 🛡️

- Secure Signing & Reporting
Nethereum + HSM/multi‑sig support for enterprise-grade transaction approval and compliance reporting. 📜🔑

## Core Components
1. GUI Interface
    - Tauri + Rust front‑end yields tiny binaries (< 10 MB) and high security via strict CSPs.
    - egui alternative delivers a pure‑Rust, statically‑linked UI with zero web dependencies.
    - Wallet Management supports private keys, mnemonics, JSON keystores, and hardware wallets (Ledger/Trezor), with per‑wallet labeling and real‑time balance display.

2. Trading Engine
    - Built on Botvana—a high‑performance, event‑driven Rust framework for market‑making and arbitrage (https://github.com/featherenvy/botvana)
    - Barter‑rs bindings allow Pythonic backtesting and paper‑trading, ingesting historical tick data for strategy tuning.
    - Async web3.py v7 module monitors the mempool, manages nonces, and submits signed transactions with granular gas controls (https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/v7.3.0/release_notes.html)

3. Monitoring & Risk Management
    - Flashbots Protect RPC hides transactions from frontrunners, offering MEV fee rebates and sandwich‑attack immunity(https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/overview)
    - Slippage & Gas Caps configurable per‑transaction; global stop‑loss/take‑profit halts all strategies on PnL breach.
    - Validator Health Checks poll Lido validators and EigenLayer delegations to ensure consistent restake operations.

## Smart Contract Suite
Arbitrage Contracts
- Curve Finance Pools (stETH/ETH) contracts enable on‑chain price checks and trade execution when deviation > X% (https://decentralized-finance.io/curvefinance-crv/)

Delta‑Neutral Strategy
- Aave stETH Deposit + ETH Borrow + Short ETH achieves market‑neutral exposure, auto‑rebalanced via on‑chain triggers (https://sperax.io/blog/what-are-delta-neutral-strategies-in-defi)

Restaking Modules
- Lido V3 Vaults offer modular, compliance‑ready staking “vaults” with customizable validator sets and MEV management (https://v3.lido.fi/)
- EigenLayer Restake integration delegates stETH into EigenLayer smart contracts, unlocking additional yield streams via liquid restaking (https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/restakers/restaking-guides/restaking-developer-guide)

## Transaction Workflow
1. RPC/API Connection to Infura/Alchemy for on‑chain data and tx submission.
2. Transaction Builder computes optimal maxFeePerGas and maxPriorityFeePerGas using web3.py’s drop‑in defaults
3. Offline Signing via Nethereum or local key store, supporting HSM and n‑of‑m multi‑sig workflows
4. Bundle Submission through Flashbots for atomic MEV‑resistant execution
5. Receipt & Monitoring: track confirmations, parse events, and adjust strategies dynamically.

## Multi‑Wallet & Customization
- Profiles let you assign unique strategy parameters, risk limits, and scheduling to each wallet.
- Batch Controls to start/stop or pause strategies across selected wallet subsets.
- Export/Import JSON–YAML config for reproducible deployments and easy onboarding.
- Real‑Time PnL Dashboard per wallet, with CSV/Excel export for compliance reporting.

## Security & Performance
- Rust core ensures memory safety, zero‑GC pauses, and sub‑millisecond event handling
- Hardware Wallet integration with Ledger/Trezor plus optional HSM support for institutional key custody.
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions runs tests on Goerli and Sepolia, auto‑publishes audited Solidity contracts.
- Incident Response: automatic alerts for RPC failures, high reorgs, or validator downtime, backed by Slack/email notifications.
