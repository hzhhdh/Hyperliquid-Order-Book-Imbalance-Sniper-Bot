### 2. Connect Your Wallet
Import your non-custodial wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Ledger, Trezor, Keplr, or Exodus) to securely manage your private keys. The app integrates with:

- Ethereum (Web3.js, Etherscan)

- Cardano (Cardano API, Cardano Explorer)

- Solana (Solana Web3.js, Solana Beach)

- Polkadot (Polkadot.js, Subscan)

- Cosmos (Cosmos SDK, Cosmoscan)

- Avalanche (Avalanche API, Avascan)

- Tezos (Tezos API, TzStats)

- Algorand (Algorand SDK, AlgoExplorer)

### 3. Select Cryptocurrency and Amount
Choose a cryptocurrency (ETH, ADA, SOL, DOT, ATOM, AVAX, XTZ, or ALGO) from the dropdown menu and enter the amount to stake (e.g., 10 ETH). The app validates your input to ensure sufficient balance.

### 4. Choose or Optimize Pools
Stake through leading platforms, including:

- Ethereum: Uniswap V3 (liquidity staking), Lido Finance, Rocket Pool.

- Cardano: Minswap (liquidity staking), Cardano Stake Pools (via Daedalus/Yoroi).

- Solana: Raydium (liquidity staking), Marinade Finance.

- Polkadot: Polkadot Native Staking, Karura (liquidity staking).

- Cosmos: Osmosis (liquidity staking), Keplr-based validator pools.

- Avalanche: Trader Joe (liquidity staking), Avalanche Native Staking.

- Tezos: Tezos Native Staking (via bakers), Plenty DeFi.

Algorand: Algorand Governance, Yieldly (liquidity staking).
Manually select from available staking pools or enable auto-optimization to allocate assets to the highest-yielding pools (e.g., Cosmos Pool #2 at 15.0% APY).

### 5. Monitor and Analyze
View real-time metrics on the monitoring panel, including stakes, rewards, APY, and TVL. Use the analytics panel to track performance and forecast earnings, powered by data from Etherscan, Cardano Explorer, Solana Beach, Subscan, Cosmoscan, Avascan, TzStats, and AlgoExplorer.

### 6. Manage Rewards
Reinvest rewards automatically or withdraw them to your wallet. The app calculates estimated rewards (e.g., $1,850 in 30 days) based on current stakes and APY.

### 7. Stay Updated
Receive live updates on network status and TVL, ensuring your stakes are secure and optimized. Refresh metrics manually to get the latest data from blockchain APIs.
