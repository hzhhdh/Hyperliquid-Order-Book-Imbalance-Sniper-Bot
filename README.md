## 📖 Program Description
This project provides a fully automated, rules‑based trading and liquidity management solution for tokens. Its modular architecture guarantees high performance and security by:

- Maintaining and boosting liquidity: Your token’s liquidity is continuously monitored and injected when necessary—crucial for reducing volatility and slippage.

- Preserving trading volume: Automated small-scale trades keep the market active and dynamic, ensuring high trading volume just like top-tier algorithmic trading systems.

- Boosting market capitalization: Through strategic buybacks, the system reinforces token value, making it attractive for investors.

- Enhancing transparency: A real‑time dashboard with detailed logs and metrics delivers complete visibility and trust to token creators and investors.

Optimized for DeFi, crypto trading, blockchain integration, and high‑frequency trading environments, this software leverages state‑of‑the‑art technologies that power projects like Uniswap, SushiSwap, and Raydium.

## 🛠️ How to Use the Engine

### Example: Rust Trading Engine Function (Liquidity Injection)
```
rust
// Example usage in Rust:
// Execute liquidity preservation logic based on current metrics

fn main() {
    let current_liquidity = 50000.0;
    let min_threshold = 60000.0;
    let liquidity_injection = 15000.0;

    // If liquidity is below threshold, inject liquidity
    if current_liquidity < min_threshold {
        preserve_liquidity(current_liquidity, min_threshold, liquidity_injection)
            .expect("Liquidity injection failed");
    }
}
```
### Example: Python Wallet Creation & Transaction Signing
```
python
# Example usage in Python:
from blockchain_module import create_wallet, connect_to_blockchain, sign_transaction, send_transaction

# Define wallet parameters and create a smart wallet with risk controls
predefined_params = {
    "default_spending_limit": 1000000,
    "fee_tolerance": 0.005,
    "risk_parameters": {"max_trade_size": 100000},
    "preferred_tokens": ["USDC", "ETH", "RAY"]
}

wallet = create_wallet(predefined_params)
web3 = connect_to_blockchain()

# Create a dummy transaction (self-transfer for demonstration)
nonce = web3.eth.get_transaction_count(wallet['address'])
tx = {
    'nonce': nonce,
    'to': wallet['address'],
    'value': 0,
    'gas': 21000,
    'gasPrice': web3.toWei('50', 'gwei')
}

signed_tx = sign_transaction(web3, tx, wallet['private_key'])
tx_hash = send_transaction(web3, signed_tx)
print("Transaction successful with hash:", tx_hash)
```
### Example: JavaScript React Dashboard
```
jsx
// Example usage in React (Dashboard.js):
import React from 'react';
import Dashboard from './Dashboard';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Dashboard />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
