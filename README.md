## Key Features

1. Honeypot Detection & Safe Entry Module

    - Manual Honeypot Filters: Users predefine conditions for ERC-20 token purchases on Uniswap V3:

        - Liquidity locked ≥3 months (verified via Unicrypt or Team Finance).

        - No blacklisted functions (e.g., transfer tax >5%).

        - Audit status (user selects: "Audited by CertiK," "No audit," or "Community verified").

    - Buy Triggers: Execute purchases only if:

        - Token price is ±10% of launch price (user-adjustable).

        - Trading volume exceeds $500k in 1 hour (threshold customizable).

2. Cross-Protocol Arbitrage Engine

    - Uniswap-to-dYdX Pipeline:

        - Price Deviation Threshold: User sets a % difference (e.g., 5%) between Uniswap spot price and dYdX perpetual futures.

        - Buy on Uniswap: Purchases tokens if undervalued relative to dYdX.

        - Hedge on dYdX: Automatically opens a short/long position on dYdX (leverage set manually: 1x–10x).

Example: If UNI trades at 10 on Uniswap and 10.50 on dYdX, the bot buys on Uniswap and shorts on dYdX to lock in a $0.50 profit per token.

3. Dynamic Liquidity Management (Uniswap V3)

    - Manual Price Ranges: Users define liquidity provision ranges based on market outlook:

        - Bullish: Concentrate liquidity in the +5% to +15% range.

        - Bearish: Focus on -10% to -5% for accumulation.

        - Sideways: Set tight ranges (±2%) to maximize fee income.

    - Auto-Compounding: Reinvests earned fees into stablecoins or blue-chip tokens (user-selectable).

4. Risk Mitigation Modules

    - Stop-Loss & Take-Profit:

        - Stop-loss: Triggered if price drops X% below entry (e.g., 15%).

        - Take-profit: Sell Y% of position at Z% profit (e.g., sell 50% at +30%, 50% at +50%).

    - Slippage Control: Limits trades to <2% of pool liquidity to minimize price impact.

    - Circuit Breaker: Pauses trading if portfolio drawdown exceeds user-defined thresholds (e.g., 5% loss in 1 hour).

5. Multi-Market Strategies

    - Bull Market: Buy tokens with rising volume + positive funding rates on dYdX.

    - Bear Market: Short tokens with high open interest and negative funding rates.

    - Sideways Market: Provide liquidity in stablecoin pairs (e.g., USDC/DAI) with tight ranges.

6. Priority Gas Auction (PGA) Module

    - Dynamic Gas Bidding: Automatically adjusts gas fees to outbid competitors during high-demand periods (e.g., token launches, news events).

        - Users set a max gas price (e.g., 150 Gwei) and a "bid aggression" slider (low/medium/high).

        - Bot monitors pending transactions in the mempool and prioritizes orders by gas price.

Example: Snipes a trending meme coin launch by paying 20% higher gas than the current average.

7. MEV-Resistant Order Flow

    - Private Transaction Relay: Integrates with Flashbots or Taichi Network to submit orders directly to miners/validators, bypassing public mempools and avoiding front-running.

    - Sandwich Attack Protection: Splits large orders into smaller, randomized chunks over 1–5 minutes to disguise trading intent.

8. Liquidity-Aware Order Splitting

    - Slippage Minimization: For large trades ($100k+), the bot splits orders across:

        - Multiple liquidity pools (e.g., Uniswap V3, Sushiswap).

        - Time intervals (e.g., 10% of order every 30 seconds).

    - DEX Aggregator Integration: Routes trades via 1inch or CowSwap to find the best price across all DEXs.

9. Limit Order Triggers with Fill-or-Kill

    - Customizable Limit Orders: Users set:

        - Price thresholds (e.g., buy if ETH drops to $3,000).

        - Time-in-force (e.g., "Fill 50% within 5 minutes, cancel the rest").

        - Post-only orders to avoid paying taker fees.

Example: Place a limit order to buy BTC at $60k on dYdX, valid only if Uniswap’s BTC/ETH pair deviates by 2%.

10. Real-Time Liquidity Pool Monitoring

    - Liquidity Alerts: Tracks Uniswap V3 pools for:

        - Newly added tokens with locked liquidity.

        - Sudden liquidity withdrawals (rug-pull warning).

Auto-Exit: Sells tokens immediately if pool liquidity drops below a user-defined threshold (e.g., -30% in 10 minutes).

11. Cross-Protocol Atomic Arbitrage

    - Instant Profit Loops: Executes simultaneous trades across protocols in a single transaction (e.g., buy on Uniswap, sell on dYdX) using flash loans or self-funded capital.

        - Requires pre-approved token allowances and smart contract logic.

Example:

        - Borrow USDC via Aave.

        - Buy undervalued UNI on Uniswap.

        - Sell UNI on dYdX at a 5% premium.

        - Repay loan + fees in one atomic transaction.

12. Customizable Transaction Scheduling

    - Time-Based Triggers: Schedule trades during low-competition periods (e.g., 3 AM UTC when gas fees are low).

    - Event-Based Triggers: Execute orders after specific on-chain events (e.g., Coinbase listing, Fed rate announcements).

13. Pre-Emptive Cancellation

    - Cancellation Bots: Deploys a secondary bot to cancel pending transactions if:

        - Price moves against the user’s position before confirmation.

        - Competing bots are detected with higher gas bids.

14. Liquidity Provider (LP) Sniping

    - LP Front-Running: Monitors new Uniswap V3 LP positions and buys tokens before liquidity is fully active.

        - Users set filters (e.g., minimum LP size: $500k).

Example: Snipes a new LDO/ETH pool with $2M liquidity, buying LDO before price adjusts.

15. User Reputation System

    - Tiered Access: High-frequency traders earn "trust scores" for:

        - Low failed transaction rates.

        - Consistent profitability.

    - Priority Access: Top-tier users get early access to new features or token launches.

## Workflow Example

    - Token Detection:

        - Bot scans Uniswap V3 for new tokens.

        - Filters out tokens with unlocked liquidity or blacklisted functions.

    - Entry:

        - Buys SAFE token at t0.50 if volume exceeds $1M and liquidity is locked for 6 months.

    - Cross-Protocol Action:

        - Deposits $SAFE into dYdX as collateral.

        - Opens a 5x short if dYdX perpetual price is 8% higher than Uniswap.

    - Exit:

        - Sells SAFE on Uniswap at t0.65 (take-profit).

        - Closes dYdX short when futures premium narrows to 2%.

## Unique Selling Points

    - Full Manual Control: No AI "black box"—users set every parameter (e.g., price ranges, leverage, risk thresholds).

    - Cross-Protocol Profit Loops: Exploit price gaps between spot (Uniswap) and derivatives (dYdX).

    - Honeypot Resistance: Prevents losses by enforcing user-defined safety checks.

    - Gas Optimization: Prioritizes transactions during low-fee periods (user sets max gas price).

## Technical Implementation

    - Smart Contracts:

        - Uniswap V3 integration via V3 Quoter and NonfungiblePositionManager.

        - dYdX StarkEx API for order execution.

    - Oracles: Chainlink for Uniswap pricing, Pyth Network for dYdX data.

    - UI Dashboard:

        Parameter sliders for honeypot checks, stop-loss, and leverage.

        Real-time alerts for price deviations and liquidity pool changes.

## How to connect to telegram
In just a few steps—creating a bot via BotFather, installing the python-telegram-bot library, implementing polling or webhooks, and deploying your integration—you can push ArbiDeFi arbitrage alerts to your Telegram channel or group. Register the bot with BotFather to get your token . Install the official python-telegram-bot package via pip. Choose between getUpdates polling or webhook-based delivery to receive updates. Then, in your scanner code, call ```bot.send_message(chat_id, text)``` to dispatch alerts. For production, secure your webhook URL with HTTPS and follow security best practices for Telegram bots

Prerequisites
Telegram Bot Token: Create a new bot by chatting with @BotFather and running ```/newbot```—you’ll receive an API token in the form ```123456:ABC-DEF…``` .

Python Environment: Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed.

Dependencies: Install the ```python-telegram-bot``` library:
```
bash
pip install python-telegram-bot
```

1. Creating & Configuring Your Telegram Bot
Talk to BotFather

Open Telegram, search for @BotFather, and send ```/newbot```.

Follow prompts to name your bot and receive its token.

Store Your Token Securely

Do not hardcode it in public repos; use environment variables or a secure vault.

2. Basic Polling Integration
Polling is the easiest way to get started without setting up servers.
```
python

from telegram import Bot, Update
from telegram.ext import Updater, CommandHandler

TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
updater = Updater(token=TOKEN, use_context=True)
dispatcher = updater.dispatcher

def start(update: Update, context):
    context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text="ArbiVault Pro Bot Online!")

start_handler = CommandHandler('start', start)
dispatcher.add_handler(start_handler)

# Send an example arbitrage alert
def alert_alert(chat_id, text):
    updater.bot.send_message(chat_id=chat_id, text=text)

updater.start_polling()  
updater.idle()
```

3. Webhook-Based Deployment
For lower latency and reliability, use webhooks over HTTPS: 

Expose a Secure URL (e.g., via nginx with TLS).

Set the Webhook:
```
python

bot = Bot(token=TOKEN)
bot.set_webhook(url="https://your-domain.com/telegram_webhook")
```
Handle Incoming Updates in your web framework (Flask, FastAPI, etc.).

Process & Reply with ```bot.send_message(chat_id, text)```. 

4. Integrating ArbiVault Pro Alerts
In your arbitrage scanner loop, trigger alerts like so:
```
python
from telegram import Bot

bot = Bot(token=TOKEN)
CHAT_ID = "YOUR_CHAT_ID"  # e.g., a group or channel ID

def on_arbitrage_opportunity(opportunity):
    message = f"🦄 Arbitrage Alert:\nPair: {opportunity.pair}\nProfit: {opportunity.profit:.2f}%"
    bot.send_message(chat_id=CHAT_ID, text=message)

# Example usage when your scanner detects a trade
on_arbitrage_opportunity(opportunity)
```
You can obtain ```CHAT_ID``` by messaging your bot and calling getUpdates or using ```@get_id_bot```.

5. Security Best Practices
HTTPS Webhook: Always serve your webhook endpoint over TLS.

Token Rotation: Periodically revoke and regenerate tokens via BotFather.

Least Privilege: Grant your bot only the permissions it needs (e.g., send messages but not admin rights).

Input Validation: Sanitize and validate all incoming data to avoid injection attacks .

6. Testing & Go-Live
Local Testing: Use polling mode on localhost first.

Staging: Deploy to a staging server with HTTPS before production.

Monitoring: Log successes/failures of send_message calls and set up alerts.
